Who Am I?
I consider myself as a senior (at least on a time scale :) Full Stack Developer, working since 1999 for many companies.

Quick Background History: 
After dropping my studies as C/C++ Programmer in 1998 got a full-time Job as PHP Developer in a very cool Multimedia company P***** AG, there I developed Projects for big guns like Aral, Radici Plastics, Computer+Science, DRK, Eurami, Reederei-Schwaben, and many others. I also co-developed an In-house CMS-System and countless customer-specific Intranet Projects (Gambro/KVSW), mostly Back-End.

After IT-Bubble ara everything slowed down and so did my employer. I moved forward to another company and managed to find another job for a smaller company and worked there till 2012 as Senior PHP/MySQL Developer, later till 2019 worked for another company mostly working on PHP/MySQL Database Automation Projects, e.g. Data Management Tools, Data Qualification and Automation all based mostly on HP/MySQL, developed also a Software for Outbound Call-Center which handled more than 200 million hits a month. From 2019 - 2020 I worked for a Professional Software developer company as a Back-End Developer worked on porting procedural modules to MVC and PHP Code upgrades. After all the expertise in PHP, I am still learning new things to challenge myself.

Who Am I?
I consider myself as a senior (at least on a time scale :) PHP-Backend developer, working since 1997 for many companies.

Quick Background History: 
After dropping my studies as C/C++ Programmer in 1998 got a full-time PHP development Job in a very cool company ***** AG. There I developed Projects for big guns like Aral, Radici Plastics, Computer+Science, DRK, and many others. Developed a CMS-System and countless dynamic Websites, mostly Back-End. After the IT Bubble burst, I managed to find another job for a smaller company and worked there till 2012, later till 2019 worked for another company working mostly on Database Automation Projects and a new CRM. I am still not retired and now busy with many interesting projects in my free time.

Life Achievements:
1996 PC Game (Shazy - Adventures of Hackman) distributed by CDV Software Karlsruhe.
1999 Co-developed CMS
2005 First Large scale CRM Software based on PHP/MySQL
2006 Small scale Database Automation with MySQL/PHP
2012 Large scale Database Automation + CRM Software based on MySQL/PHP + Microsoft SQL-Server Entp Integration.
2014 Appointment scheduling + Route management
2016 Smart Routing + Sales management solution
2020 Many small projects (most of them confidential :) 

I am interested in
experimenting with new Technologies merging Back-End with Front-End like Livewire, or Tailwind breaking the Bootstrap limits :)

I am now planning to release some of my old personal projects in the future, and open to any collaboration on Laravel or procedural PHP.

btw my last Job agreement ended a few months ago so am free to hire :)
